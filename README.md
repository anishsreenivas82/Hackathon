# Hygiene4You
## About
An app that simplifies the distribution of excess toiletries and hygiene products from stores and hotels to shelters that tend to people without housing.    
**Goal:** to track and manage the logistics of distribution to make the process simpler for both the shelter and the donor.    
**Background:**  Grocery and retail stores have a regular supply of products, which means that at any given time they also have products nearing expiration. Hotels too, can have an excess of hygiene products. These excess products, if redirected to people in need at the right time, could make sure that their basic needs are met. Individuals can also give back as volunteers to assist in verification.  
This is currently the first alpha build of the app and the full features are yet to be implemented.     
There is enormous scope to further the cause, which is to track and manage the logistics of distribution to make the process simpler for both the shelter and the donor. Collaboration with companies with an existing delivery chain, as 'delivery partners' can ensure end to end connectivity. Additionally, features to let the shelter make requests based on requirement could be implemented.  
### Overview
At the outset you can sign in/sign up as either a Donor, Volunteer or a Shelter.     
A Donor, i.e, a store or a hotel willing to donate, enters the product details and quantity. Once entered, a QR code is generated for a particular product. After submission, the product is now pending to be verified and is visible under ‘pending verifications’ on the Donor’s dashboard.     
This now falls into the volunteer’s court. A volunteer registers through the app and enters in their location. He/she can now view a list of products which are to be verified. On accepting a verification request based on convenience, the volunteer proceeds to verify the product on-spot. Simply scan the product’s QR code, upon which product details and checkboxes come up. After inspection, a product can be accepted or declined.   
Once a product is verified and accepted, it shows up on the shelter’s page as ‘Available donations’ and the donor’s dashboard under ‘Accepted donations’.
