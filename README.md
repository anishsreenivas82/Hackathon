# Hygiene4You
## About
An app that simplifies the distribution of excess toiletries and hygiene products from stores and hotels to shelters that tend to people without housing. This is 
currently the first alpha build of the app and the full features are yet to be implemented. 
There is enormous scope to further the cause, which is to track and manage the logistics of distribution to make the process simpler for both the shelter and the donor. Collaboration with compaines with an existing delivery chain, as 'delivery partners' can ensure end to end connectivity. Additionaly, features to let the shelter make requests based on requirement could be implemented.
